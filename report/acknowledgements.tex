\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

 I would like to profusely thank Dr.\ Ned Nedialkov for his invaluable inculcation and great patience that helped me accomplish this project. I also want to show my appreciation to Gary Tan and Shawn Li, two honorable men who gave me a lot of help and encouragement during the project and in daily life. I would also like to show my gratitude to every professor, such as Dr.\ Franya Franek, Dr.\ George Karakostas, Dr.\ Ridha Khedri etc, in my graduation courses, who selflessly shared their knowledge and experience with me.
