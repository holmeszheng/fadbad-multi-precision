Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques to evaluate numerically the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. The FADBAD++ package developed by Ole Stauning and Claus Bendtsen implements the forward, backward, and Taylor modes utilizing C++ templates and operator overloading. 
It enables users to differentiate functions that are implemented in built-in C++ arithmetic types (such as double) or other customized class types. This report describes a multi-precision extension of the forward and Taylor modes in FADBAD++  using the GNU MPFR library.
